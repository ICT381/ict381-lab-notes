## Welcome

This MAC folder contains the MAC version of the lab notes for the course.

The provided guides here use the MAC commands.

During class, the instructor will be going through Windows OS with WSL. If you want to use your MAC, you can follow the lab guide (`LAB_0A_MAC`) to setup your environment for MAC.

Students are still advised to follow the lab guides in the main folder for the overall course structure.
